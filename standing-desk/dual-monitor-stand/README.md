# dual-monitor-stand

I purchased [Ergear Dual Monitor Stand for 13 to 32 inch, Heavy Duty Fully Adjustable Monitor Stand for 2 Monitors, Dual Monitor Mount Fits up to 17.6 lbs per Arm, EGCM1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B082MLVXRR/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
to go with my [FLEXISPOT Standing Desk 48 x 30 Inches Height Adjustable Desk Electric Sit Stand Desk Home Office Desks Whole Piece Desk Board (Black Frame + Black top,2 Packages)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07H2W9Y3W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

Because I like my monitors pretty high, I printed this shim and extenstion.
The shim allows the stand arms to float above a standard height PC tower better.
And the extension gives me the eye level I need. (Glue the extension into the pipe for stability.)
