# cable-management

## description
Because I purchased the [FlexiSpot Height Adjustable Desk Leg Casters Wheels Set of 4 pcs](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0732QT98V/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) to go with my [FLEXISPOT Standing Desk 48 x 30 Inches Height Adjustable Desk Electric Sit Stand Desk Home Office Desks Whole Piece Desk Board (Black Frame + Black top,2 Packages)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07H2W9Y3W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) I need additional cable management to keep adapter boxes and longer cables "up and mobile."

This shelf should help provide more desk mobility.
